    diff - difference between high and low price (buying/selling price)
    start_min - the minimum price of the good at the start of the game
    start_max - the maximum price of the good at the start of the game
                Prices will be randomly set for each nation at the start of a
                new game.
    min       - the minimum price of the good
    max       - the maximum price of the good
                Prices will raise and fall during the game, depending on how
                much of a good the player buys and sells. These limits make
                sure the price stays with a certain range.
