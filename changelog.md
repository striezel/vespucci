* __[fix]__
  The hover text that is shown when the mouse cursor hovers over the goods bar
  in the colony view is no longer obstructed by the box that displays the name
  of the building which is currently under construction.

* __[improvement]__
  Terrain textures for wetland and marsh are added.

* __[improvement]__
  The building textures for the college, the fur trader's house, the rum
  distiller's house, the warehouse expansion and the weaver's house are added.

* __[improvement]__
  In the colony view, the colony icon is shown in the center square to indicate
  more clearly that those squares are the fields around the colony. Furthermore,
  rivers (if any) around the colony are now shown in those squares, too. When
  the mouse hovers over one of those squares, the terrain type is now explicitly
  mentioned, too.
